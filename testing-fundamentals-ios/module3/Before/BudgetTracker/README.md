# Getting Started

The Xcode project is not included in the resources. In a **Terminal** window, go to the **BudgetTracker** directory and run:

`open Package.swift` 

Once Xcode pulls in its dependencies, change the **Scheme** to **Run** and the **Destination** to **My Mac** to run the Vapor server.
