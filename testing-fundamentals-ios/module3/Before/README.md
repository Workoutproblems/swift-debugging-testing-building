# Getting Started

- This module contains the Vapor server. Instructions to open it are in the **BudgetTracker** folder.

- The **Before** project for **BudgetTrackeriOS** has **ApiClient** already defined in its own **ApiClient.swift** file. Because this code is used in multiple view controllers, in order to not have a long clip refactoring all the view controllers, the **Before** project includes this file already.
